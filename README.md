# project Global Universities

## Project plan

CSIRT.global is a worldwide, non-profit, volunteer-led organization dedicated to addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Through proactive identification, owner notification, and incident prevention, CSIRT.global contributes to a safer digital environment.

Core Activities:

* Bug Bounty Programs
* Vulnerability Research
* Incident Response (CSIRT)

## Background
Cyberattacks increasingly target universities and academic institutions worldwide. A recent incident at Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) highlighted the urgency for enhanced cybersecurity. Hackers were detected in real time, disrupting education and delaying exams. Such attacks not only cause operational disruptions but also jeopardize sensitive student, faculty, and research data. University-affiliated medical centers face similar risks. A proactive cybersecurity approach is essential to maintain educational and research continuity while minimizing damage. This research initiative stems from the urgent need to address growing cyber threats. Through research, CSIRT.global seeks to map vulnerabilities and support universities in enhancing security.

Many universities lack sufficient insight into their digital vulnerabilities, making them more susceptible to cyberattacks. The key contributing factors include:

* Limited Proactive Measures: Many universities react only after an incident rather than identifying and mitigating threats in advance.
* Resource & Expertise Deficiency: Universities often lack the necessary resources and specialized knowledge to counter sophisticated cyber threats effectively.
* Complex Digital Infrastructure: Universities operate extensive IT environments, making it challenging to maintain comprehensive vulnerability oversight.

Without proper security measures, cyberattacks can lead to data breaches, educational and research disruptions, and reputational damage.

Project Objective: This project aims to improve the current cybersecurity landscape by identifying vulnerabilities, implementing security improvements, and increasing resilience against cyber threats. Without this initiative, the academic sector remains an attractive target for cybercriminals, with potentially severe societal consequences.

## Project Objectives

During their internship at CSIRT.global, students will research multiple universities to identify and analyze vulnerabilities in their digital infrastructure.

### Prerequisites

Before commencing research, students must complete the DIVD Academy Ethical Hacker Course to gain certification and ensure safe usage of cybersecurity tools, including:

* Kali Linux – Penetration testing platform.
* Nmap – Network scanning and vulnerability detection.
* Metasploit Framework – Exploitation and proof-of-concept testing.
* Wireshark – Network traffic analysis.
* Burp Suite – Web application security testing.
